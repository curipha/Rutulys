Rutulys
=======
Rutulys transforms plain text into static websites.
It is designed as a content management system with least functionality.

For example, this program does NOT contain plain text parser (e.g. Markdown parser).

It just outputs a HTML file from a text file with some processing.
You can define 'some processing' as you want.
(Of course, you can define it as converting from Markdown to HTML.)
